    "text": "As a lifelong student, I believe that student success grows from collaboration, sustained effort, and a growth mindset. My teaching philosophy centers on creating a supportive and engaging classroom environment that fosters mutual respect, academic curiosity, and intellectual rigor. I encourage active participation, clear and timely communication, and a strong commitment to learning. For me, education extends beyond the transmission of knowledge; it is about cultivating critical thinking, sharpening problem-solving skills, and inspiring a passion for lifelong learning. I challenge students to move beyond their comfort zones, engage with diverse perspectives, and embrace new ways of thinking. At the same time, I am committed to providing the resources and mentorship that allow students to succeed both academically and personally—whether through one-on-one meetings, virtual office hours, or interactive learning platforms. My goal is to help students reach their full potential and leave the classroom equipped to engage thoughtfully with the world around them."

    "text": "My research agenda investigates how credibility, legitimacy, and national values shape the international system. I focus on how both states and multinational corporations project democratic and liberal ideals abroad, and how audiences in developing societies interpret, contest, or resist those claims. By combining survey experiments with qualitative archival research, I examine how domestic political practices, human rights performance, and global economic actors influence the effectiveness of democracy promotion and the spread of values across borders.\n\nWhen Values Diverge: The Impacts of Western Multinational Corporations on Cultures and Values in the Global South — This project examines how Western multinational corporations influence values in non-Western developing societies. Drawing on archival and qualitative research in South Africa and Nigeria, it investigates how corporate culture, consumer interactions, and branding can transmit Western values through workplaces, lifestyles, and symbols of material progress.\nForeign Aid, Donor Credibility, and the Public Foundations of International Legitimacy — This project explores how people in Nigeria view U.S. democracy and how those perceptions influence their response to American efforts to promote democracy abroad. Using a survey experiment, the study examines if U.S. democratic shortcomings and racial identity-based perceptions shape trust in governance and the credibility of donor states at a time when alternative governance models are gaining traction.\nIn Word or Deed: The Impact of Human Rights Violations on the United States’ Global Image — This project investigates how human rights violations in the United States, particularly those highlighted during the Black Lives Matter movement, shape how other countries view America’s credibility as a defender of democracy and human rights. Drawing on a survey experiment in Nigeria, the study examines how foreign publics respond when the United States criticizes other governments’ human rights records while failing to uphold the same standards at home."

    "text": "My passion for political science began long before I knew to call it that. As a kid, I loved learning America’s stories of nation-building — the inspirational ones told to children — but I was just as captivated by the histories of slavery, abolition, and the civil rights movement. These narratives made me proud to be a Black American, part of a people who, as Henry Louis Gates Jr. remarked, “walked the stoniest of roads.” At the same time, I was endlessly curious about the rest of the world, far beyond the 5 p.m. news cycles that reduced other societies to wars, failed governments, or natural disasters. In my imagination, people everywhere were also walking stony roads of their own. Those early interests have persisted, shaping how I see connections between humanity, society, and ultimately international politics.\nI pursued this curiosity at Prairie View A&M University, graduating in 2021 with a B.A. in Political Science, and I began graduate study at Rice University in Fall 2021.\nToday, I study how race and global political and economic hierarchies shape interactions in the international system. My research examines how both political and economic actors — from democratic states to multinational corporations — exercise influence, transmit values, and navigate the constraints of hierarchy. Through this work, I aim to advance understanding of the limits and possibilities of power in a changing, multipolar world."
